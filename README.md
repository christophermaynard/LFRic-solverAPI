# LFRic-solverAPI

The solver API for the LFRic code. Krylov subspace solvers are written in terms of abstract vectors, abstract linear operators and abstract preconditioners.

Included is a simple line vector and a diagonal preconditioner. Also a 1-d Poisson operator and a symmetric random matrix so the solvers can actually run.
